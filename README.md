# Mediate

Mediate is the world's most awesome media aggregator! You have been tasked to build it for a cohort of demanding clients that want to find the best movies and music to promote their brands.  To build and test the app, you'll use [`unmock`](https://githutb.com/unmock/unmock-js).

Here are the two APIs you'll be using.

| API                                                                       | Description   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [Rotten Tomatos](https://developer.fandango.com/docs)                     | Movie Reviews |
| [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) | Music         |

Happy hacking!
